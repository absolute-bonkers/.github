# 🛠️ Introduction to Design Patterns 🛠️

Welcome to the world of Design Patterns!<br/> 
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.<br/>
They are the building blocks that help you create flexible, maintainable, and scalable software systems. <br/>
In this introduction, we will explore what design patterns are, why they matter, and provide an overview of the different types of design patterns.

## 📖 What Are Design Patterns?

*Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.<br/> 
They provide a template for how to solve a problem in a way that has been proven to work. <br/>
Rather than reinventing the wheel for every project, design patterns offer a reliable framework to guide your design decisions.*

## 🔑 Why Use Design Patterns?

	•	Improved Code Readability: Patterns make your code easier to read and understand for other developers.
	•	Faster Development: By reusing established solutions, you can reduce development time and effort.
	•	Enhanced Flexibility: Patterns promote loose coupling, making it easier to change or extend your code without breaking existing functionality.
	•	Better Collaboration: A shared vocabulary among developers facilitates communication and collaboration.

## 🔍 Types of Design Patterns

*Design patterns can be broadly categorized into three main types:**

### Creational Patterns 🏗️

*These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.<br/>
They help manage object creation complexity while promoting code reusability.*

### Structural Patterns 🧩

*Structural patterns focus on composing classes and objects into larger structures while ensuring that they work together.<br/>
They help simplify the design by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between entities.*

### Behavioral Patterns 🕺

*Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.<br/> 
They help define how objects interact in a manner that is more flexible and less coupled.*
